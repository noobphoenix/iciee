<p align="justify"><strong>Research Title : </strong>
Prof. Rosni Abdullah is a professor in parallel computing and one of the national pioneers in the said domain. She was appointed Dean of the School of Computer Sciences at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) in June 2004,
after having served as its Deputy Dean (Research) since 1999. She is also the Head of the Parallel and Distributed Processing Research Group at the School since its inception in 1994. </p>



<p align="justify">Her main interest lies in the data representation and the associated algorithms to organize,
  manage and analyse biological data which is ever increasing in size. Particular interest is in the development of parallel
  algorithms to analyse the biological data using Message Passing Interface (MPI) on message passing architectures and
  multithreading on multicore architectures. <br>

Currently, the new interest is in neuroinformatics, i.e. the management and analysis of neuroscientific data
